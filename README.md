Thought i'd make html and css fun to learn with this project, I wanted to create something where I can store my ideas, blog about projects and share my art. 
When i first discovered neko web it opened me up to so many web designs that showed the capability of web design, a lot of web designers create a variety of fresh websites that are fun to navigate and explore.
The notepad is where ideas start, and that was the main motivation behind the design. 

This project became an escape from modern day technology, I'm hoping to create my own true and authentic little corner of the internet. 
The project will be uploaded to https://nekoweb.org/ after completion, nekoweb is a free static website hosting service.
